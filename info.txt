Installed less@2.7.2 globally to utilize .less files, which allow nesting, variable and function usage in css.

// npm install -g less@2.7.2 //

To convert from .less to .css, use the command: 

// lessc styles.less styles.css //

Also installed sass as a dev dependency to utilize .scss files, which allow the same as .less but use $ instead of @ for their
operations and needs more information.

// npm install --save-dev node-sass@4.7.2 //

To convert from .scss to .css, we first need to add this line into the scripts on package.json:

// "scss": "node-sass -o css/ css/" //

Then, run the command:

// npm run scss //
